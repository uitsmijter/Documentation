# About

Uitsmijter is a versatile OAuth2 authorization server and a Kubernetes Middleware for Traefik.

On one hand, it provides a flexible and powerful basis for new projects; on the other hand, it has been built with the
focus of comfortably bringing existing, mostly monolithic applications into the microservice, cloud, and multi-cloud world.

It offers multi-tenant single sign-on via secure, low-maintenance, and easy-to-implement middleware, as well as
protocol-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization workflows. Both processes work hand in hand and, after minimal and
easy-to-understand configuration, can be operational in a short time following foolproof and fully automated (Infrastructure as Code)
installation.

A company-wide login can be put into operation in the shortest possible time in a vendor-neutral manner without
data specifications for your user profiles, and even without changing the user database. It is important that your data
content, data structures, and data management can be determined by you at any time.

Uitsmijter does not provide its own user data storage but offers interfaces to use your
existing databases and services in a simple, secure, and elegant way.

## Uitsmijter is guided by original RFCs

The original RFC for OAuth 2.0 endpoints is "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework", which was published
as [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) in October 2012. This RFC defines the overall framework for
OAuth 2.0, including the authorization process, the different grant types (such as authorization code and refresh
token), and the roles of the various actors involved (such as the client, the resource owner, and the authorization
server).

In addition to RFC 6749, there are several other RFCs that define specific aspects of the OAuth 2.0 framework. For
example, [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html) defines the Bearer Token usage, which specifies how to
use access tokens in HTTP requests.

All information you need to install, configure, and run the server, as well as configure the client libraries, is covered
in this documentation. Our goal is to present everything you need in an understandable language. If you find
some aspects are missing, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:sales@uitsmijter.io). We are continuously improving the documentation.
Your feedback is welcome.
