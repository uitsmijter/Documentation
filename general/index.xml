      <description>About     Uitsmijter is a versatile OAuth2 authorization server and a Kubernetes Middleware for Traefik.
On one side it provides a flexible and powerful basis for new projects, on the other hand it has been built with the focus to comfortably bring existing, mostly monolithic applications into the microservice, cloud- and multi-cloud world.
It offers multi-tenant single sign-on via secure, low-maintenance and easy-to-implement middleware, as well as protocol-compliant OAuth 2.</description>

      <description>Motivation     Since the mid-nineties, we from aus der Technik have been dealing with the authentication and authorization of users. The conception as well as the implementation of access systems is an elementary part of our work on clients applications. For new implementations, the first choice is between the numerous existing open source or proprietary authentication systems, or the decision for or against a custom implemented solution. Not only the numerous diverse requirements count on a decision-making process, but also legal questions about user data management have to be considered individually.</description>
